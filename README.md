# Raft
Implement the Raft consensus algorithm in Go language.

--> The program should simulate a network of N nodes, where N is a configurable parameter(can be passed as an argument).


--> Each node should be able to propose a value and send prepare and accept requests to other nodes.


--> The program should demonstrate that the algorithm guarantees that a value is chosen by a majority of the nodes and that the chosen value is the same for all nodes.


--> The program should handle failures of nodes.
